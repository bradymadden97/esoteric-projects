This repo is some of my experiments with unusual programming languages.

## About
#### brainfuck-minimizer.py
This python script takes a brainfuck file and "minimizes" it, by removing all but the 8 brainfuck characters:
```
. , < > - + [ ]
```
The script also reformats the code to 75 characters per line.

#### word-shifter.bf
This brainfuck program takes an input of two strings of the same length, and shifts the first string one character at a time to match the second string.
For example:
```
hello world
```
Will output:
```
wello
wollo
worlo
worlo
world
```

## How to Use
#### Brainfuck
I used this <a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-brainfuck-online">JDoodle</a> simulator to execute my brainfuck scripts.
